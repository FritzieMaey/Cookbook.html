<h2><b><hr>Bulalo</hr></h2></b>
<img src="bulalo.jpg" alt="Bulalo" width="200" height="200" border="5">
<dl><br>Bulalô is a beef dish from the Philippines. It is a light colored soup that is made by cooking beef
shanks and bone marrow until the collagen and fat has been melted into the clear broth.
It typically includes leafy vegetables, corn on the cob, scallions, onions, garlic, ginger, and fish sauce.</br> </dl>
<ul>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
<li>    2 beef marrow bones (cut to expose marrow on one end)</li>
   <li> 1 pound beef shank</li>
   <li> 1 onion quartered
    <li>3 cloves garlic
   <li> 1 teaspoon black peppercorns</li>
  <li> 2 tablespoons patis (fish sauce)</li>
    <li>Salt (to taste)</li>
    <li>2 cobs corn (cut into 2-inch segments)</li>
    <li>1 chayote (peeled and cubed)</li>
    <li>3 baby bok choy (leaves separated)</li>
    </ul>
   <ol>
     <h4>Instructions</h4>
    <li>Boil a large pot of water. 
     the marrow bones and beef shank and return to a boil. 
     Continue boiling until you don't see any more red blood coming from the meat or bones (about 10 minutes), then remove the meat and bones with tongs and scrub under cold water to remove any scum. Dump the water in the pot out and rinse the pot. This process rids the meat of excess blood and will ensure your soup is nice and clear.
    </li>
    <li>Return the cleaned meat and bones to the pot then add the onion, garlic, peppercorns and patis. Cover with water then bring it to a rolling boil and skim off any scum that accumulates.</li>
       <li> Reduce the heat to medium low. If you are using a pressure cooker, fix the lid and let it cook for 1 ½ hours. If you're not using a pressure cooker, simmer until the meat on the shank is fork tender (4-5 hours). Skim off any excessive fat from the top but do not remove it all (remember, fat=flavour). Transfer the meat and bones to a bowl, then strain the stock through a fine mesh sieve, discard the solids then return the meat and bones to the strained stock.
    </li>
    <li>Add the corn and chayote and simmer for another 20 minutes or until the chayote is tender. Salt to taste, then add the bok choy at the last minute. Serve with rice.</li>

    <h2><hr>Mango Float</hr></h2>
      <img src="mangofloat.jpg" alt="Mango Float" width="250" border ="5" >
      <dl>Filipino mango float is a no bake dessert with layers of cream, mango and graham crackers. The mango float is super easy to make but waiting to eat is agony! You will need to refrigerate the dessert overnight to ensure that the cream settles and the crackers become soft.</dl>
    </center>
      <ul> 
       <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <li> Heavy cream, chilled overnight</li>
    <li> Sweetened condensed milk, chilled overnight</li>
      <li>Mangos</li>
      <li>Crackers</li>
      </ul>
      <ol>
      <h4>Instructions</h4>
      <li>Make sure your mangos are ripe and sweet. Peel the skin and slice mangos thinly or you can chop the mangos. Set aside.</li> 
    <li>Whip heavy cream until soft peaks form. Then gradually add pinch of salt and condensed milk. Whip cream until stiff peaks form. Tip: chill the heavy cream, condensed milk, and bowl in the fridge for a few hours or overnight for easy whipped cream!</li>
    <li>Crush graham crackers until desired crumb or use the whole cracker without crushing. I like it crushed for a soft crumble texture.</li>
    <li>Let's start layering the mango float in a 8 x 8 inch glass container or a large container. First lay the graham crackers. Then, whipped cream. Lastly, add sliced mango. Repeat one more time. For the last layer, add whipped cream and sliced mango. You can also add more graham cracker crumbs at the top for decoration. </li>
    <li>Cover the container and refrigerate overnight for soft texture (like bread pudding). Another option is to freeze overnight for ice cream texture. Before eating, thaw for 30 minutes or less depending on what texture you like. </li>

        This is the only crispy fried chicken recipe you'll ever need. Why? It combines all the tried-and-true tricks to ensure the juiciest, most flavorful, crispiest chicken every time.
    </br> </div>
    <ul>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <li>
        1 (4 pound) chicken, cut into pieces
        </li>
    <li>
        1 cup buttermilk
        </li>
    <li>
        2 cups all-purpose flour for coating
        </li>
    <li>
        1 teaspoon paprika
        </li>
    <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
    <li>
        2 quarts vegetable oil for frying
    </li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
    <h4>Instructions</h4>
    <li>Take your cut up chicken pieces and skin them if you prefer. </li>
    <li>Put the flour in a large plastic bag (let the amount of chicken you are cooking dictate the amount of flour you use). Season the flour with paprika, salt and pepper to taste (paprika helps to brown the chicken). </li>
    <li>Dip chicken pieces in buttermilk then, a few at a time, put them in the bag with the flour, seal the bag and shake to coat well. </li>
    <li>Place the coated chicken on a cookie sheet or tray, and cover with a clean dish towel or waxed paper. LET SIT UNTIL THE FLOUR IS OF A PASTE-LIKE CONSISTENCY. THIS IS CRUCIAL! </li>
    <li>Fill a large skillet (cast iron is best) about 1/3 to 1/2 full with vegetable oil. Heat until VERY hot. </li>
    <li>Put in as many chicken pieces as the skillet can hold. Brown the chicken in HOT oil on both sides. </li>
    <li>When browned, reduce heat and cover skillet; let cook for 30 minutes (the chicken will be cooked through but not crispy). Remove cover, raise heat again, and continue to fry until crispy. </li>
    <li> Drain the fried chicken on paper towels. Depending on how much chicken you have, you may have to fry in a few shifts. Keep the finished chicken in a slightly warm oven while preparing the rest.

    <div><br>
        This is a traditional Filipino recipe for bihon pancit. Very easy to prepare, my chewy rice noodles are tossed with vegetables and chicken, and cooked in a sweet and savory sauce. Not only is it delicious, it only takes 25 minutes to make from start to finish.
    </br></div>
    <ul>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <li>Peanut Oil</li>    
    <li>Chicken Breast</li>
    <li>Garlic</li>
    <li>Onion</li>
    <li>Bihon Noodles</li>
    <li>Mixed vegetables</li>
    <li>Pancit Sauce: A mix of low sodium chicken stock, dark soy sauce, soy sauce, oyster sauce, and sugar.</li>
    <li>Salt and Pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <h4>Instructions</h4>
    <li>Sauce. Whisk all the ingredients for the sauce in a bowl and set aside.</li>
    <li>Chicken. Place a medium size pan on a burner over medium heat. Add a little oil and pan fry the chicken until the pieces are cooked through. Transfer them to a plate and set aside.</li>
    <li>Garlic and onions. Use the same pan to add the garlic and onion, and cook for 3-4 minutes until fragrant and the onions have become translucent.</li>
    <li>Cooked chicken and veggies. Return the chicken pieces to the pan and season with a little salt and pepper. Add the vegetables and stir fry until the vegetables are soft but still yielding a little crunch.</li>
    <li>Add the sauce. Whisk the sauce, add it to the pan, and bring it to a boil.</li>
    <li>Cook the noodles. Add the dry pancit noodles to the pan and let the heat from the sauce cook them. Gently toss the noodles to make sure they are evenly coated. The noodles will get infused with tons of flavor this way as opposed to just being coated with sauce. They should be cooked in 3-4 minutes. If the noodles are still crunchy once the sauce has been absorbed, add a little stock (1/4 cup) to help them cook through.</li>
    <li>Season and serve. Turn the heat off and transfer the dish to a serving bowl or plate. Season with salt and pepper and serve with soy sauce and lemon wedges.</li>

    <div><br>
        Rice is the ultimate leftover food. Not only is it totally customizable with whatever additional protein and veggies you have in the fridge, but it's crazy simple to make too.
    </br></div>
<ul>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <li>1 1/2 c. long-grain rice (preferably jasmine), or about 2 1/2 c. leftover rice</li>
    <li>3 Tbsp. peanut or vegetable oil, divided</li>
    <li>3 large eggs, beaten to blend</li>
    <li>5 cloves garlic, grated or finely chopped</li>
    <li>1 (1") piece ginger, peeled, grated or finely chopped</li>
    <li>4 scallions, white, pale green, and dark green parts separated, thinly sliced</li>
    <li>2 Tbsp. reduced-sodium soy sauce</li>
    <li>1 tsp. granulated sugar</li>
    <li>1 tsp. kosher salt</li>
    <li>1/2 tsp. white pepper</li>
    <li>1/4 tsp. MSG</li>
    <li>1/3 c. frozen peas</li>
    <li>1 Tbsp. unsalted butter, cut into pieces</li>
</ul>
<ol>
    <h4>Instructions</h4>
    <li>Fill a large pot about halfway with water and bring to a boil. Meanwhile, thoroughly rinse rice in a strainer until water runs almost clear.</li>
    <li>Cook rice in boiling water for 3 minutes, then drain with a fine-mesh strainer that fits in pot. Wipe out pot, pour in about 2" water, and bring to a simmer. With rice in strainer, make a few divots in rice through to bottom of strainer with a chopstick or butter knife.</li>
    <li>Cover strainer with foil, then place in pot over simmering water. Place pot lid over strainer; if there’s a lot of steam escaping, wrap foil or a damp tea towel around rim of pot and strainer. (This can also be done in a bamboo steamer or a standard steaming setup that won’t let the rice fall through.)</li>
    <li>Steam until rice is cooked through but still slightly al dente, about 15 minutes; it should have a drier feel than normal steamed rice. Spread onto a baking sheet and let cool to room temperature. Refrigerate until ready to use.</li>
    <li>Heat a large wok or well-seasoned cast-iron skillet over high heat. Pour in 1 tablespoon oil and swirl wok to coat. Once oil is shimmering, add eggs and cook, breaking up into small pieces, until cooked through but not browning, about 1 minute. Transfer to a plate. Wipe out wok.</li>
    <li>In same wok over high heat, swirl remaining 2 tablespoons oil. Cook garlic and ginger, tossing constantly, until fragrant and garlic begins to brown, about 30 seconds. Add white and pale green scallion parts and cook, tossing constantly, until softened, about 1 minute. Add rice and immediately toss to combine. Fry rice, stirring constantly, until no clumps remain and you begin to hear some light popping sounds from the rice toasting, 2 to 3 minutes.</li>
    <li>Add soy sauce, granulated sugar, salt, pepper, and MSG and cook, tossing constantly, until soy sauce is absorbed, about 1 minute. Add eggs, peas, and dark green scallion parts and cook, tossing constantly, until warmed through and incorporated, about 2 minutes more. Add butter and cook, tossing, until melted, about 30 seconds more.
